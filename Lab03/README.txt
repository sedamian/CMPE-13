Lab 3

A summary of the lab in my own words:
	This lab was a lab where we had to create a calculator in the 
Mplab. This would have to calculate the entries of the matrices. 
Some were adding while otheres were more complicated such as finding
the inverse. I think that the more important aspects of this lab was
the arrays right. The thing that was mostly stressed was the use of for
loops shich turned out to be very useful.

	My approach was to skim the manual. This is what I usually do. Then
I look for the example outputs to see what I am up against. After this
is when I look at the instructions. I will then create the project and 
begin looking for things to do. The main problem I had was managing time 
in this lab. The thing that I was stuck on was #include MatrixMath.h 
in the MML.c file. This screwed me over. Other than that I was ok.

	It ended up coming out smoothly. I averaged about 24 hours.
I liked finishing the lab and going home. I disliked the fact that there
needs to be other classes in the lab. I think that this IT department
if they exist, should install the right compiler on the college computer rooms
or at Oakes at least. I find this to be very unorganized and it makes me wonder 
where all my tuition is going. Don't you wonder that? It is crazy. Yes the grading
seemed appropriate. Yeah it did cover the material. No, I figured it on my own.
It wasnt hard because of my background in Java.
