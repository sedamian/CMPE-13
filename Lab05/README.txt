Lab 5




A summary of the lab in my own words:
	This lab was a lab where we had to create a Sorter in the 
notation of Link Lists. This would have to go through an array using pointers and 
they will be using double link lists. now the point of this, get it i said point, but 
seriously, the main aspects were getting the functions to work. understanding the 
pointers was key in this lab. One speed bump was the fact that there was a NULL character
which only added a little bit more checking and a little bit more code.
Some were adding while otheres were more complicated such as finding
the sorted word count. I think that the more important aspects of this lab was
the arrays right. The thing that was mostly stressed was the use of for
loops shich turned out to be very useful. This was very hard because of syntax.

	My approach was to skim the manual. This is what I usually do. Then
I look for the example outputs to see what I am up against. After this
is when I look at the instructions. I will then create the project and 
begin looking for things to do. The main problem I had was managing time 
in this lab. The thing that I was stuck on was #include LinkedList.h 
in the sort.c file. one thing that confused me was the fact that I had ->data
instead of -> nextItem. This screwed me over. Other than that I was ok.

	It ended up coming out smoothly. I averaged about 30 hours.
I liked the feeling of finishing the lab and going home. I disliked the fact that there
needs to be other classes in the lab. I think that this IT department
if they exist, should install the right compiler on the college computer rooms
or at Oakes at least. I find this to be very unorganized and it makes me wonder 
where all my tuition is going. Don't you wonder that? It is crazy. Yes the grading
seemed appropriate. Yeah it did cover the material. No, I figured it on my own. The 
examples that were given were terrible.
