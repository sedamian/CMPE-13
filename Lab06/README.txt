A summary of the lab in my own words:
	This lab was a lab where we had to create a led display on the board in the 
notation of Event driven structures. We grasped the concepts of interupts.
 This would have to go through a header that we made with my own hands and 
they will be using structs. now the point of this, get it i said point, but 
seriously, the main aspects were getting the functions to work. understanding the 
pointers was key in this lab. One speed bump was the fact that there was a buttons functions
which only added a little bit more checking and a little bit more code.
Some were adding while otheres were more complicated such as finding
the sorted word count. I think that the more important aspects of this lab was
the arrays right. The thing that was mostly stressed was the use of for
loops shich turned out to be very useful. This was very hard because of syntax.

	My approach was to skim the manual. This is what I usually do. Then
I look for the example outputs to see what I am up against. After this
is when I look at the instructions. The lab manual was complete dog crap. it was too 
confusing and was hard to follow. I will then create the project and 
begin looking for things to do. The main problem I had was managing time 
in this lab. The thing that I was stuck on was #include buttons.c
in the part3.c file.  I was ok.

	It ended up coming out smoothly. I averaged about 40 hours.
I liked the feeling of finishing the lab and going home. I disliked the fact that there
needs to be other classes in the lab. I just found out that apparently my hash was not 
submited for lab two. got me so mad. I go t a zero. The ITs department should install
 the right compiler on the college computer rooms it is currently 1.43 or something.
or at Oakes at least. I find this to be very unorganized. No the grading did not
seem appropriate. Yeah it did not cover the material. No, I figured it on my own. The 
examples that were given were pretty bad. There were very little examples.
