Lab 10
rpg lab   	6/14/17


A summary of the lab in my own words:
	This lab was a lab where we had to create rpg game using the repo thing that we use. 
I initially thought that we were maing our own game so that is what I was expecting however,
When I realiesd that I was dishearted. The functions were one thing that I think I got right. 
That worked well but I couldnt test it. This would prove to be helpful as it save time and 
works wonders. One speed bump was the way this lab manual stated things. For example, the main
function was very vague, it would have helped it made sense so it would have been nice. 
This would have made my life a lot easier since I had to go through with a function I made and the 
function might not even be how they wanted it because sometime the rubric is picky. Hope not.


Approach:
	My approach was to read the manual. However, this was confusing, so I went to the lecture
and it confused me even more, I had no idea what was happening. I was able to get the makefile done. 
I followed the video lecture and followed the end of the lab manual to get this oart done.
The thing that messsed me up wwas the decoding. I had know Idea how to do that for the longest time
If I did this lab again, I would probably do this lab a little bit quicker, and I think that 
I would have went to office hours. No I did not work with anyone else in this lab. Working 
by myself was a bad decision. 



Result:
	The result was a lab that was not quite finished. I averaged about 30 hours. And it was
mostly me going on and off struggling about my other finals that I was worried about. I do not
plan on going home after this lab, I have to stay and study for a final that is the next day. 
I wish I spent more time on this lab but I spent most of my time working on the battleboats which
pushed over studying and The worst part is that I had another final that needed to be done before 
this labs submissions so I was working on that. I guess what I have to say is that Im sorry and please
dont grade me that hard. I didn t really like anything about it. I dont think it was a worthwhile lab. 
I think that it could have been easier. The grading did seem appropriate. For future labs I think we
should be able to create our own games. The One thing that continue to say is 
that the ITs department should install the right compiler on the college computer rooms 
it is currently 1.43 or something and at Oakes at least and at Cowell stevenson. 
I find this to be very dissapointing.
