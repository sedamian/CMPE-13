This lab took about 4 days to complete. But the work was stop and go.
It was NOT a continuous 96 hours


Parts that were difficult or unclear. 
Id say that the parts that were unclearwas the fact that the 
computer labs at Oakes had a different compiler
version 1.4 so I sat there lik an idiot trying to figure out what was wrong.
It was the heap file and then scanf wasnt working. 
I think that this schoolshould talk to the IT department. (if we have one)
But we should definitely get that fixed. We just need to install it but the 
installation is block with and administration password.

As for the lab, I found it to be pretty straight forward. The rounding thing was simple
The first thing that popped into my head worked. I guess I'm good at logic.
One thing that I was skeptical on was the fact that we had to call operations into our main.
Back in CE100 it was easy you just need to call an instance. So I guess I related the two
I also followed the Round one, that was stubbed in it already.
So I think that it is good to have examples for learning new things.
Well, for me atleast.
