Lab 7




A summary of the lab in my own words:
	This lab was a lab where we had to create a a toaster oven display on the board using 
a finite state machine using interupts flags and timers. We grasped the concepts of interupts.
This would have to go through a header that we made with my own hands (the leds.h )and 
they will be using structs.Another inportant aspoect of this lab was using the switch state
cases instead of doing the if statements. Thi would prove to be helpful as it save time and 
works wonders. One speed bump was the way this lab manual stated things. For example, the floating
point numbers, we were not allowed to use them. However in class I saw Max doing division. 
This would have made my life a lot easier since I had to go through with a function I made and the 
function might not even be how they wanted it because sometime the rubric is picky. Hope not.

	My approach was to read the manual breifly. This proved to be the worst thing I had done 
it puts me in a position of where my code might not actually work like they want. I come up with
some pretty narly equations. And I use what I have.. Then I look for the example outputs to 
see what I am up against. I will then create the project and begin looking for things to do. 
The main problem I had was managing time in this lab. well not really.  

	It ended up coming out smoothly. I averaged about 20 hours.
I liked the feeling of finishing the lab and going home. The worst part I would have to say is
the state diagram given was pretty bad. it was confusing an I had a hard time. I wishh that the 
video given to us had more detail on all the possible cases. this would make things more clear.
It would be harder to do everything so blindly. The One thing that continue to say is 
that the ITs department should install the right compiler on the college computer rooms 
it is currently 1.43 or something.or at Oakes at leastand at cowel stevenson. 
I find this to be very unorganized. No the grading did not
seem appropriate. Yeah it did not cover the material. No, I figured it on my own. The 
examples that were given were pretty bad. There were very little examples.
